<h1>My Favorite Quote</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>"<strong>LOVE</strong> is patient, <strong>LOVE</strong> is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. <strong>LOVE</strong> does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.&quot;</em></p>
